## Approach

### Community Driven
 
As part of the engineering initiative at dunnhumby, we're doing our best to get everyone included in the 
infrastructure renewal process. This includes having a 
[Matter(s)most Channel](https://mattermost.dunnhumby.com/default/channels/cloud-engineers) where we're actively 
discussing the development of everything from design proposals for infrastructure components, right through to 
compliance and service management, including things like security too. 


### Development Approach

For the [core][1] and [contrib][2] projects of cloud engineering, we strive adhere to s test-driven approach to 
development. Primarily using the [behave][3] behaviour driven development framework for python. You can read more
about our development approach [here](some-page.md).

### Task Organisation and Management

We use [Jira][4] for managing our current Epics and Stories. On the 
[Cloud Engineering Jira Board](https://jira.dunnhumby.co.uk/ceng) you will find the currently elaborated Epics and 
planned Milestones. The board has a swimlane per release, and are organised in order of release. There is a
[Backlog Board](https://jira.dunnhumby.co.uk/) where Epics are elaborated and releases are planned based on our themes 
of work.

!!! tip "Join the conversation on our Jira boards!"

    If you see a task in our Jira board that might affect your progression in terms
    of the tech renewal programme, then let us know by commenting on our jira tasks.

    Prioritising work is hard, and one of the main challenges we face with such a huge
    renewal effort is **developer addoption**. Yes, we mean you! So please, contribute to our
    jira board if there's a task on there that may not be our priority right now but 
    is currently a barrier to adoption - let us know!
