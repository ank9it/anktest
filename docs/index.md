# Cloud Engineering <small>documentation</small>

Welcome to the Cloud Engineering Documentation site. The purpose of this site is to be the home of all documentation
associated with the cloud engineering effort. This is to include everything from the initial design and architecture 
documents, right through to operations and service management.

!!! warning "Please read this before you continue..."

    For this site to be maintained long term, it has to be well maintained
    and kept up-to-date with the any changes to the infrastructure or any
    governance or process associated with it.
    This responsibilty will never lie with a single team, meaning any change 
    to infrastructure or process must be reflected in this documentation.

    In order to support this, there is a [contribution guide](contributing.md)
    which should be read thoroughly before using and making changes to this 
    documentation.
