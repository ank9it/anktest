# Getting started

## Introduction to the Site

This documentation site is aimed at a very wide audience. It has separate sections aimed at particular audiences, but
the aim here is to be transparent and so each part of the site is accessible to all.  The site is split into these
components:

* [Infrastructure Design](#infrastructure-design)
* [Security and Compliance](#security-and-compliance)
* [Service Management](#service-management)
* [Operational Support](#opreational-support)

We may add more components later, or you could add some yourself with a [Merge Request](contributing.md). Below we 
will attempt to explain each of these components roles in the tech renewal programme. More importantly, however, we 
will explain how the cloud engineering effort will address the compliance and governance requirements going forward.

## Infrastructure Design

This component is aimed at anybody that wants to understand the approach to infrastructure in the
cloud, even including the nitty-gritty of the implementation. This includes everything from network architecture or
virtual machine instance types to which cloud platform services we use. Where appropriate this
documentation should also serve as justification for some of these decisions, which will hopefully spark internal
discussions on changing these decisions as the architecture evolves.
